        <h2>I. 1. Introduction to Screenwriting</h2>
        <p>I'm sure you all know and maybe have at least one favourite movie or more. They have all kind of sorts of scenes, no?

        <p>Screenwriting is the process of writing scripts for movies, television shows, video games, and even web series. A screenwriter crafts the story, the characters, and the dialogue that will eventually come to life on the screen. A screenplay acts as a guide for the entire filmmaking process. It provides descriptions of scenes, outlines character actions, and details every line of dialogue the actors will speak.</p>
